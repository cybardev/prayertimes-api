# prayertimes-api

API to fetch Islamic prayer times for a given date and location using `GET` requests and query parameters

## Usage

Use query parameters to retrieve prayer times. For example, to get prayer times of 2023-11-09 at latitude 44.65 and longitude -63.59 use:

<https://prayertimes.cybar.dev/?year=2023&month=11&date=9&latitude=44.65&longitude=-63.59>

**PS**: My API was made as a learning exercise. Soon after deployment, I came to know about the wonderful Al Adhan API (linked in the Credits section). Use that API for anything serious, as it's more robust and feature-complete. I will likely not maintain mine beyond what is already here and will use the Al Adhan API for future endeavours if needed.
